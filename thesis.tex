\vspace{10mm}
Agent-based models are becoming increasingly useful in studying the behavior 
of real-world complex multi-agent systems; however, one of the outstanding 
challenges in the modeling of coupled natural and human systems is the 
dearth of techniques for creating agents that are able to learn from their
past failures and successes, as well as compounded environmental and social
uncertainties. This research has been focused on the integration of
traditional agent-based modeling with machine learning methodologies for
modeling agent decision-making and its recursive impacts on economic,
environmental, and societal outcomes, feeding into the dynamic co-evolution of
the coupled natural and human system state variables within simulated worlds,
resulting in the development of two models incorporating and exploring the use
of deep reinforcement machine learning as a driver for decision-policy making
in agent-based models.

The first of these models is a model of agricultural land use and the adoption
of agricultural best-management practices by farmers in response to ecological
and economic scenarios as a result of municipal regulation and variance in the
occurrence of extreme weather events. The primary study area used for the
model is a region of the Missiquoi Bay Area of Lake Champlain in Vermont,
containing 480 farmer agents corresponding to agricultural land parcels within
the region. A parameter sweep and sensitivity analysis on model
hyperparameters was conducted to explore the effects of changes to agent
calibration and training on agent decision-making and model performance.

The second model expands upon the scope of the first, including forester
agents and commercial and residential urban agents within a larger region of
the Lake Champlain Basin of Vermont. Additionally, the impacts of agent
decision-making take place on the simulated landscape, resulting in gradual
land cover change over time. Land cover data from the United States Geological
Survey's National Land Cover Database was used for initial parameterization,
calibration, and training of the model (years 2001, 2006) and model testing
(year 2011).

Results suggest that with appropriate scoping and hyperparameter selection,
the integration of deep reinforcement machine learning techniques into the
development of agent-based models can increase predictive accuracy in the
modeling of real-world phenomena; however, these gains must be weighed against
the increased technical complexity of such a model and the associated risk of 
introducing model error.
